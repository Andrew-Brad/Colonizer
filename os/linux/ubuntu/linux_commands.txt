# discover all storage devices attached to your system
lsblk

# fdisk requires root privileges in most cases. 
# If you don't have root privileges, you can list storage devices files beginning with sd in the /dev directory : this should give you enough information:
ls -l /dev/sd*

# list all mount points, and storage capacity
df -h

# to unmount or 'detach' a device
umount /dev/sdb1

# before mounting these blindly, verify the device using above commands
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/yourfolder

# show files marked deleted that are still locked by some process
sudo lsof / | grep deleted

# top 5 biggest directories in the home folder, ignore permission denied as some of those are in system folders and such

# Copy a Directory and All Subdirectories Locally (Copy Files and Directories Recursively)
# -a archive flag: The archive mode behaves like the recursive mode (-r) but keeps all file permissions, symbolic links, file ownership, etc.
# -v combined with --progress shows a more detailed progress output
